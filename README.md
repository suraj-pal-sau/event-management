# 🌐 Server Setup

## 🔑 Environment Variables
First, create the environment variables file `.env` in the `backend` folder. The `.env` file should contain the following variables:

- `PORT` = `5000` or any port number
- `MONGODB_URI` = `your MongoDB connection URL`
- `JWT_SECRET` = `your secret key for JWT - must be secured`

Example `.env` file:
- MONGODB_URL = `your MongoDB URL`
- JWT_SECRET_KEY = `any secret key - must be secured`
- PORT = `5000` or any port number
- AUTH_EMAIL = `your email address to send the OTP`
- AUTH_PASSWORD = `password to your email account` (used Hotmail for email verification)



## 🗄️ Set Up MongoDB:
1. Setting up MongoDB involves a few steps:
    - Visit the MongoDB Atlas Website: [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
    - Create an Account or Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account
    - Create a New Cluster
    - Choose a Cloud Provider and Region
    - Configure Cluster Settings
    - Create Cluster and wait for it to deploy
    - Create a Database User
    - Set Up IP Whitelist (Allow access from your IP or everywhere for testing)
    - Connect to Cluster and copy the connection URL
    - Configure your application by adding the URL to the `.env` file
    - Test the Connection using MongoDB Compass or your application

2. Create a new database (e.g., `event_management`) and configure the `.env` file with the MongoDB connection URL.

## 🚀 Steps to Run Server
1. Open the project in your editor of choice.
2. Navigate into the server directory: `cd backend`.
3. Run `npm i` to install the packages.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.

If configured correctly, you should see a message indicating that the server is running successfully and `Connected to MongoDB`.

# 🖥️ Client Side Setup

## 🔑 Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for the client side in this project. However, ensure the backend API URL (`http://localhost:5000`) is accessible from the frontend.

## 🚀 Steps to Run Client
1. Navigate into the client directory: `cd frontend`.
2. Run `npm i` to install the packages.
3. Run `npm start` to run the app on `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# 🖼️ Admin Dashboard Setup
The admin dashboard is integrated into the same frontend application as the client side, accessible via the `/admin` route after logging in with admin credentials.

## 🔑 Environment Variables
No additional environment variables are required for the admin dashboard.

## 🚀 Steps to Access Admin Dashboard
1. Ensure the frontend is running (`npm start` in the `frontend` folder).
2. Log in with admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Navigate to `/admin` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/admin`) to access the dashboard.

# 🔒 Security Note:

## Environment Variables:
- Safeguard your environment variables by storing them securely and not exposing them unintentionally.
- Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the environment variable configurations (e.g., do not commit the `.env` file to GitHub).

## Database Security:
- Use strong credentials for MongoDB users.
- Restrict IP access in MongoDB Atlas to trusted sources.
